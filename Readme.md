This is some notes about my experience and research on web development.

State of the art mean the latest, cost effective, trends.

I divide State of The Art (SOTA) into few category that divide the kind of web you want to build:

1. Landing Page, Information Page, Blog.

You want just simple web, few amazing web front-end. few creativity.

Just use:

- Wordpress
- Shopify
- Blogger

2. High Costumization, High Creativity, High Skill, High Cost

Use:

- React js
  With massive adaption in this framework, available alot of NPM library to help your development.

- Typescript
  For knowing what data type (integer,string,etc..) variable in javacript.

- [React Three js](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
  Animation and 3D object on the web is required these days. user will leave your website if in first 5 seconds interaction with your website not make user impressed. boring website.

  How about heavy load? 3D and animation require large js and 3d assets. but in this era 4G it doesn't matter.
  or you can using lazy load technic. using [react lazy and suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactlazy)

- Laravel
  PHP not die, Laravel keep updating. per six months comes with latest development methodology.
